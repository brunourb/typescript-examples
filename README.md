# Node + VSCode + TypeScript starter project template (supports debugging)

This project allows you to write NodeJS code in Typescript.
I wrote this because teach students another languague to know.

Anyway, this lets you,
a) Write NodeJS code in Typescript, and
b) Offers full intellisense
c) Supports VSCode debugging.
